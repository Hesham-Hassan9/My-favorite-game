       <h2>Spoilers ahead </h2>
        <p> 
        Trying to understand the overarching narrative of the Assassin's Creed series and how they connect to each other is as intimidating as it can be difficult. We'll help make the process as painless as possible. If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game before and you're looking to get into the franchise with Valhalla, here's the story so far.<br>

        For the web site of MY favorite game, we'll be delving into the main Assassin's Creed games only. The franchise also has several long-running comic series and spin-off games that continue the meta-narrative, however, it's unreasonable to assume everyone should go out and buy all of them, though Ubisoft oddly tied up important storylines outside of the games which we'll briefly touch upon in the modern-day section.<br>

        If you're interested in a particular game or the modern-day story itself, you can jump right to any of those sections.

       <p>Before reading through some of the games' plots, I'd familiarize yourself with these important terms that will help you understand the plot going forward.</p>
       <p><strong id="terminology">The Animus</strong></p>
       <img src="https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/10/assassins-creed-animus-v2.jpg?itok=Ah4xlXTp" >

       <p>The Animus is a machine that analyzes DNA and allows people to relive their ancestors' memories. This is the reason that we are playing through historical time periods in Assassin's Creed. The technology is eventually enhanced in the <br>series so that anyone using an Animus (later called the Helix) can relive anyone's memories, not just someone related to them.</p>

       <p>Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, an assassin living during the Third Crusade, is tasked by Assassin Brotherhood Mentor Al Mualim to retrieve a powerful artifact known as a Piece of Eden, specifically the Apple of Eden. His arrogance during this mission costs the life of a fellow assassin and permanently disables another. Al Mualim then demotes him within the Brotherhood and gives him nine Templar targets to <br>take out. Upon killing the ninth, Templar Grand Master Robert de Sable, he returns to the assassin stronghold of Masyaf only to discover that Al Mualim betrayed the Brotherhood and stole the Apple of Eden for himself. After a fight ensues, which sees Al Mualim fall to Altair's blade, a glowing map is revealed that shows the location of more Pieces of Eden across the world.</p>

        <p>Assassin's Creed II begins during the Italian Renaissance in Florence with the birth of Ezio Auditore. Flash forward years later and Ezio is a young man who sees his father and brothers killed after being framed for treason. On his journey to avenge their deaths, he discovers that his father was a member of the secretive Assassin Brotherhood, and he takes up the mantle in his stead. <br>Traveling from Florence to Venice, stopping at a few towns in between, Ezio unravels the conspiracy taking root that sees Templar Grand Master Rodrigo Borgia becoming Pope Alexander VI. After overpowering Borgia in the Vatican, the Apple and Staff of Eden open a vault where a projection of a member of the First Civilization tells Ezio that a great catastrophe will destroy the earth in the future.</p>

        <p>Brotherhood picks up immediately after the ending of Assassin's Creed II. With the Apple of Eden in hand, Ezio retires to the country village of Monteriggioni. His life is thrust into chaos as Rodrigo Borgia's son, Cesare, <br>lays siege to the village and steals the Apple of Eden. Ezio then journeys to Rome to take down the Borgia family once and for all. After gaining enough support and rekindling the Brotherhood, Ezio is successful in defeating both Rodrigo and Cesare. He reacquires the Apple of Eden and hides it in a First Civ Temple built beneath the Colosseum.</p>

        <p>During the later years of his life, Ezio makes a pilgrimage to Masyaf in order to understand more about the Brotherhood. Unfortunately, he finds it overrun by Templars. Upon learning that the keys to Altair's secret library vault lie in Constantinople, he travels to the center of the Ottoman Empire to find them. Along the way he's caught between two warring brothers as they fight for their father's throne as Sultan. As he deals with this conflict, Ezio also <br>relives parts of Altair's past through the keys to his library, which turn out to First Civ artifacts of some sort. Settling the brothers' dispute and leaving Selim to rule, he goes back to Masyaf and enters the vault. At this point he is greeted by another member of the First Civilization who speaks through him and to Desmond (our modern day protagonist), telling him the location of a central vault that should stop the upcoming catastrophe.</p>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III follows a new assassin and jumps all the way to the American Revolution. Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor Kenway, witnesses his Native American tribe burn to the ground at an early age due to English/Templar colonizers. After learning that his destiny is to stop the Templars from seizing control, he gets caught in the midst of the Revolution while simultaneously <br>trying to do what's best for his people and way of life. This struggle takes him from the fledgling cities of New York to Boston and across parts of the frontier. He eventually retrieves a First Civ key meant for a Temple, but decides to bury it in the ground instead.</p>

        <p>Black Flag takes us back to the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. After unknowingly killing an assassin traitor, pirate Edward Kenway dons his robes in an effort to take his place in an important meeting and reap the rewards. This leads him into the age-old Assassin vs Templar conflict where he must stop those he once thought allies before they enter an ancient Observatory <br>that has the power to locate anyone on earth through the use of a Crystal Skull and blood vial. Successful in his efforts but unable to prevent the pirates' way of life from falling apart, he retires to London where he is seen living with two children, one of whom would become Connor Kenway's father from Assassin's Creed III.</p>

        <p>Another tale set in Colonial America, this time during the Seven Years' War. While on a mission to retrieve a Piece of Eden, assassin Shay Patrick Cormac witnesses the destruction of Lisbon due to an earthquake. He comes to find that the earthquake was caused by his retrieval attempts and that the Assassins knew <br>what the price would be for meddling with these First Civ objects. He becomes so disillusioned in the Brotherhood that he turns to the Templars, fearing that the Pieces of Eden would be too dangerous in Assassin hands. Shay then hunts down his former allies, with his actions kicking off the events taking place in Assassin's Creed Unity.</p>

Years later in Paris the early embers of the French Revolution are beginning to burn. Members of both the Assassins and Templars, specifically Elise, offer to parley in the hopes of peace, or at least to end <br>the current threat against the two organizations; a man named François-Thomas Germain, a Sage sowing the seeds of betrayal from within the Templars, but these offers fall through. After Arno is exiled because of his relationship and loyalties to Elise, he returns to Paris for one last fight between Germain, which ends with both Germain and Elise dead.</p>

        <p>Revolutions don't always need to bring about death and chaos, as evidenced in Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

While this is going on, Evie is on her own journey to find a Piece of Eden that she knows is hidden somewhere in the city.<br> Their adventures eventually converge as they finally reach Grand Master Crawford Starrick.

        <p>Bayek, an Egyptian Medjay (a police force of the pharaohs), finds himself on a journey of vengeance after five masked men cause him to inadvertently kill his own son. These men, known as the Order of the Ancients, are what would eventually become the Templar Order. His quest takes him all over Egypt, <br>eventually even allying him with Cleopatra's forces as she tries to seize control from her brother Ptolemy XIII. During this time Bayek discovers that one of Julius Caesar's lieutenants was one of the five masked men who was there when his son was killed. After avenging his son, Bayek and his wife Aya begin to form the Hidden Ones, what would become the Assassin Brotherhood, in order to protect the world from suffering at the hands of the Templars.</p>

        <p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the only main entry in the series to feature multiple endings. As such, the plot isn't exactly set in stone, but it follows the same paths more or less.<br>

        Set in Greece during the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), you play as Kassandra or Alexios, descendants of the legendary Spartan King Leonidas. Your character is thrown off of a cliff as a child after attempting to stop the death of their younger sibling, who an oracle prophesied would need to be sacrificed in order to stop the fall of Sparta. Presumed dead, your character grows up to become a Misthios (mercenary) and is contacted by a man to kill someone named "The Wolf of Sparta," who turns out to be your character's stepfather. What follows is a tale of close family drama as the Misthios' relatives all find themselves mixed in a plot with the Cult of Kosmos, led by your younger sibling, a group secretly responsible for causing the Peloponnesian War through harnessing the power of a Piece of Eden.<br>

       It is during this time that the Misthios also discovers the hidden city of Atlantis, guarded by Pythagoras, the Misthios' true father, and seals it from human contact. Depending on the actions you take within the game, you can reunite with your family and start to rebuild your relationship with them or you can choose to let them perish. Either way, the Cult of Kosmos is wiped out.</p>

        <p>Each game continues its modern narrative in some form, though the series featured its most cohesive narrative up until Assassin's Creed 3,<br> with future entries veering a bit off course. If you want the complete story of Assassin's Creed, then you'll want to pick up any of its several comic series.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Premise and backstory</h3>
        <p>As I've said in an earlier quick primer of the series leading up to Odyssey's release: "The crux of the modern day is the continuation of an ancient war between Assassins and Templars. The Templars, in this case, aren't the Knights Templar you may visualize. Instead, they are a group of people committed to the Templar Order's ideals under the guise of controlling a multinational corporation known as Abstergo. To put it simply: these are the bad guys."<br> 

        The Templars, and by extension, Abstergo, want to create a perfect utopia through the use of manipulation and control, which they will accomplish with Pieces of Eden. The Assassins want the same, however they believe that free will is of the utmost importance. These conflicting ideologies and desires form the basis of their feud.</p>
